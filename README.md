SMS BLAST NEMSU is an ongoing web application project initiated by Junel M. Maglunsod


Posting class announcements through communication applications like Facebook Messengger might not be helpful at it seems because of the fact that some students might not be added to specific groupchats and some students do not have the fortune to have cellular data all the time. SMS Blast is an application designed to be used by course instructors and help students especially new and transferee students be informed from class announcements via SMS. 

Information will be updated from time to time while I am working on this project.
